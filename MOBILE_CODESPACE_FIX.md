# 📱 Fix: Mobile Codespace White Screen & Restart Issues

## 🔍 Problem

When using GitHub Codespaces on mobile:
1. Opening localhost:8501 opens a new window/tab
2. Closing that window returns to a white screen
3. Refreshing causes Codespace to restart (slow)
4. Very frustrating workflow!

## ✅ Solutions (Multiple Options)

---

### **Solution 1: Fixed Port Forwarding Settings** ✅ (JUST APPLIED)

I've updated your `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to:
- ✅ Changed port 8501 from `"openBrowser"` to `"notify"` (won't auto-open new tabs)
- ✅ Set ports to `"public"` visibility for better mobile access
- ✅ Changed port 5000 to `"silent"` (no notifications)

**This will take effect on next Codespace rebuild.**

To apply immediately:
```bash
# Rebuild the container (or wait until next Codespace restart)
```

### **Solution 2: Bookmark the Direct URL** 🔖

Instead of clicking "Open in Browser" each time, bookmark the direct URL:

**Your Streamlit URL:**
```
https://CODESPACE-NAME-8501.app.github.dev
```

To find your exact URL:
1. In the Ports tab, right-click port 8501
2. Select "Copy Local Address"
3. Bookmark that URL on your mobile browser
4. Use the bookmark to access directly (no new windows!)

**Benefit:** Opens in same tab, no white screen issues

---

### **Solution 3: Keep Codespace Tab Pinned** 📌

**Quick mobile trick:**
1. Open your GitHub Codespace in one tab
2. Open the Streamlit app (port 8501) in another tab
3. Switch between tabs instead of closing
4. The Codespace stays alive as long as one tab is open

**On Mobile Chrome/Safari:**
- Use tab groups to keep both tabs organized
- Pin the Codespace tab so you don't accidentally close it

---

### **Solution 4: Use GitHub Mobile App** 📱 (BEST for Mobile)

GitHub has a mobile-optimized interface:

1. **Install GitHub Mobile App** (if not already)
2. **Open Codespace in the app:**
   - Go to your repository
   - Click "Code" → "Codespaces"
   - Open your Codespace
3. **Access ports via the app:**
   - The app handles port forwarding better
   - Less likely to cause white screens

---

### **Solution 5: Increase Codespace Timeout** ⏰

Prevent Codespace from stopping when idle:

**Via GitHub Settings:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/codespaces
2. Scroll to "Default idle timeout"
3. Set to maximum: **240 minutes** (4 hours)

**This will:**
- Keep Codespace alive longer
- Reduce unexpected restarts
- Less waiting time

### **Solution 7: Use Wake-on-Connect** 🔄

If deploying isn't an option, use this trick:

**Create a keep-alive script:**

```bash
# Add to run_all.sh
while true; do
    curl -s http://localhost:8501 > /dev/null
    sleep 300  # Ping every 5 minutes
done &
```

This keeps Codespace active by simulating traffic.
