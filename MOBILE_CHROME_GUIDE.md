# 📱 Open MockExamify in New Chrome Window (Mobile)

## 🎯 Goal
Make localhost:8501 open in a **separate Chrome window** instead of the Codespaces interface.

---

## ✅ **Method 1: Use the Ports Tab** (Easiest)

### On Mobile GitHub Codespaces:

1. **Open the Ports tab** in Codespaces
   - Look at the bottom panel or side menu
   - Find "PORTS" tab

2. **Locate port 8501** (Streamlit UI)

3. **Long-press (or tap)** on the port 8501 row

4. **Select "Open in Browser"** from the menu
   - This opens in your **default mobile browser (Chrome)**
   - Opens in a **new window**, not within Codespaces!

### Visual Guide:
```
PORTS Tab:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Port   Running Process  Visibility  │
│ 5000   Flask API        Public  🌐  │
│ 8501   Streamlit UI     Public  🌐  │ ← Long press here
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Menu appears:
• Open in Browser     ← Select this!
• Open Preview
• Copy Local Address
• Stop Port
```

---

## ✅ **Method 2: Use the Quick Access Page** (Bookmark This!)

I've created a special page that opens the app in a new window:

### Steps:

1. **In Codespaces, navigate to:**
   ```
   /workspaces/mockexamify/open_app.html
   ```

2. **Right-click → "Open Preview"** or open in Simple Browser

3. **Bookmark this page** on your mobile Chrome

4. **When you want to open the app:**
   - Open the bookmark
   - Click "Open App 🎯"
   - Opens in a **new Chrome window**!

**Why this works:** The HTML page uses `target="_blank"` which forces a new window.

---

## ✅ **Method 3: Manual URL (Most Reliable)**

### Find Your Codespace URL:

1. **In the Ports tab**, click the 🌐 globe icon next to port 8501

2. **Copy the URL** - it looks like:
   ```
   https://your-codespace-name-8501.app.github.dev
   ```

3. **Paste in Chrome** and bookmark it

4. **Access via bookmark** - always opens in Chrome!

### Your Current URL:
Based on the running app, your URL should be:
```
https://CODESPACE-NAME-8501.app.github.dev
```

(Replace CODESPACE-NAME with your actual codespace name)

---

## ✅ **Method 4: Updated Devcontainer Settings** (Already Applied)

I've updated your `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` with:

```json
{
  "8501": {
    "label": "Streamlit UI",
    "onAutoForward": "openBrowser",  ← Opens in external browser
    "visibility": "public",
    "protocol": "https"
  }
}
```

**This means:**
- When port 8501 forwards, it will **automatically open** in Chrome
- Opens in **new window** by default
- Takes effect on **next Codespace rebuild**

---

## 🔄 **To Apply Devcontainer Changes Immediately**

### Option A: Rebuild Container
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
2. Type: "Rebuild Container"
3. Select: "Codespaces: Rebuild Container"
4. Wait for rebuild (2-3 minutes)

### Option B: Restart Codespace
1. Go to GitHub → Your repository
2. Code → Codespaces
3. Click "..." menu next to your Codespace
4. Select "Restart"

## 📱 **Mobile-Specific Tips**

### Chrome on Android:
- **Long press** on port 8501 → "Open in Browser"
- Opens in Chrome as a new tab
- Swipe to switch between Codespaces and app

### Safari on iOS:
- **Tap and hold** on port 8501
- Select "Open in Browser"
- Opens in Safari as a new tab
- Use tab switcher to navigate

### Both:
- **Bookmark the app URL** for quick access
- Keep both Codespaces and app tabs open
- Switch between them instead of closing

---

## 🎯 **Recommended Workflow**

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Find your port 8501 URL from Ports tab
   - Bookmark it in Chrome
   - Name it "MockExamify App"

2. **Daily Use:**
   - Open Codespaces on mobile
   - Start app: `bash run_all.sh`
   - Open bookmarked URL in Chrome
   - Switch between tabs as needed

3. **No More Issues:**
   - ✅ No white screens
   - ✅ No accidental closures
   - ✅ Fast switching
   - ✅ Codespace stays alive

## ❓ **Troubleshooting**

### "Open in Browser" not working?
- Make sure port 8501 is running (green dot)
- Try copying the URL and pasting in Chrome manually
- Check if popup blocker is enabled (disable for github.dev)

### Still opening in Codespaces?
- Use Method 2 (Quick Access Page) - forces new window
- Or manually copy the URL from Ports tab

### App not loading?
- Make sure `bash run_all.sh` is running
- Check Ports tab shows port 8501 as "Running"
- Try the different URLs (Local, Network, External)

---

## 🎉 **Summary**

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Devcontainer configured to open in browser
- ✅ Quick access HTML page created
- ✅ Multiple methods available

**Best Method for You:**
1. Use **Ports Tab → Open in Browser** (instant, no setup)
2. Bookmark the URL for future quick access
3. Enjoy seamless mobile workflow!
