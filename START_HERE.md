## ü§ñ Option 1: Use ChatGPT (Easiest!)

I've created two ChatGPT prompts for you. Pick one and copy-paste into ChatGPT:

### Quick Prompt (Recommended)
üìÑ **File:** [CHATGPT_PROMPT_SERVICE_KEY.txt](CHATGPT_PROMPT_SERVICE_KEY.txt)

This prompt is concise and gets straight to the point. ChatGPT will guide you through:
1. Getting your service role key from Supabase
2. Adding it to your .env file
3. Restarting the app
4. Verifying it works

### Detailed Prompt (If you want extra help)
üìÑ **File:** [CHATGPT_PROMPT_DETAILED_SERVICE_KEY.txt](CHATGPT_PROMPT_DETAILED_SERVICE_KEY.txt)

This prompt includes extensive context and troubleshooting. Use this if:
- You're not familiar with .env files
- You want step-by-step validation
- You want detailed explanations

**How to use:**
1. Open the file above
2. Copy ALL the text
3. Paste into ChatGPT
4. Follow ChatGPT's instructions

## üìñ Option 2: Manual Fix (DIY)

**Step 1:** Get your service role key

```

**Step 4:** Test it

## üîê Security Note

The service role key:
- Has full database access (bypasses RLS)
- Is only used server-side (secure)
- Should never be committed to git (already in .gitignore)
- Is safe in this implementation
