I need to apply a SQL fix to my Supabase database. Please guide me step-by-step.

Project: https://app.supabase.com/project/mgdgovkyomfkcljutcsj/sql/new

Problem: My admin dashboard shows "No questions found" but the database has 85 questions. This is an RLS policy issue.

SQL to run:
```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "pool_questions_read" ON public.pool_questions;

CREATE POLICY "pool_questions_users_read"
ON public.pool_questions FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.question_pools qp
    WHERE qp.id = pool_questions.pool_id
    AND qp.is_active = true
  )
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.users u
    WHERE u.id = auth.uid()
    AND u.role = 'admin'
  )
);

CREATE POLICY "pool_questions_admin_read_all"
ON public.pool_questions FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.users u
    WHERE u.id = auth.uid()
    AND u.role = 'admin'
  )
);
```

Guide me through:
1. Opening the Supabase SQL Editor
2. Pasting and running this SQL
3. Verifying it worked
4. What to do next

Start with step 1.
