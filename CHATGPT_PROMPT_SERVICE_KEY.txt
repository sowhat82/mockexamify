I need help adding my Supabase Service Role Key to fix my application. Here's the context:

BACKGROUND:
- I have a Supabase project: https://mgdgovkyomfkcljutcsj.supabase.co
- My question pool has 85 questions but shows "No questions found" in admin dashboard
- RLS policies have been successfully applied to the database
- Code has been updated to use a service role key for admin operations
- The app is currently running but shows this warning: "No service role key found - admin operations may fail due to RLS"

WHAT I NEED TO DO:
Add my Supabase Service Role Key to the .env file so admin operations can bypass RLS policies.

MY PROJECT SETUP:
- Project ID: mgdgovkyomfkcljutcsj
- Environment file: /workspaces/mockexamify/.env
- The .env file already has these working:
  * SUPABASE_URL=https://mgdgovkyomfkcljutcsj.supabase.co
  * SUPABASE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Im1nZGdvdmt5b21ma2NsanV0Y3NqIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTk5MzY2NzYsImV4cCI6MjA3NTUxMjY3Nn0.a1ZAzp1QKS_Rr0IJmdANbypzFBGOCOqcLl4-_Oi1LOc
- There's a commented line: # SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-key-here

CODE UPDATES ALREADY MADE:
The application code has been updated to:
1. Load SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY from environment (config.py line 55)
2. Create an admin_client using the service role key (db.py lines 114-119)
3. Use admin_client for all question pool operations to bypass RLS

WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO:
Please guide me step-by-step to:

1. Navigate to the correct Supabase settings page to find my service role key
   - The URL should be: https://app.supabase.com/project/mgdgovkyomfkcljutcsj/settings/api
   - Tell me exactly what section to look in
   - Help me identify which key is the service_role key (not the anon key)

2. Show me exactly how to edit my .env file
   - The exact line to add or modify
   - The correct format (with or without quotes, etc.)
   - Any security warnings I should know

3. Tell me how to restart the application
   - The command to stop it (if needed)
   - The command to start it: bash run_all.sh
   - What log message to look for to confirm it worked

4. Help me verify it's working
   - What URL to visit: http://localhost:8501
   - Where to navigate in the admin dashboard
   - What I should see (all 85 questions)

5. Troubleshooting steps if something goes wrong
   - How to check if the key was loaded correctly
   - What log messages indicate success vs failure
   - Common mistakes to avoid

IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
- The service_role key has full database access and bypasses all RLS
- It should never be committed to git (already in .gitignore)
- It should only be used server-side
- I understand this is sensitive and will keep it secure

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
After adding the service role key and restarting:
- App logs should show: "Admin client initialized with service role key"
- Admin dashboard → Question Pool Management → View "CACS Paper 2" should show all 85 questions
- No more "No questions found" error

Please start with step 1 and guide me through this process clearly and carefully. Use screenshots or detailed descriptions where helpful.
