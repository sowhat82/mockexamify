# 🔄 Question Pool Feature - RESTORATION COMPLETE

## ✅ What Was Just Restored

Based on traces from your previous work (SESSION_SUMMARY_QUESTION_POOLS.md), I've restored the missing database methods that were likely lost in the git pull.

### Added to `db.py` (DatabaseManager class):

#### 1. ✅ `create_or_update_question_pool()`
**Lines added:** ~65 lines
```python
async def create_or_update_question_pool(pool_name, category, description, created_by)
```
**What it does:**
- Searches for existing pool by name
- If exists: Updates metadata (category, description, last_updated)
- If not exists: Creates new pool record
- Returns pool dictionary with id
- Works in both demo mode and production mode

#### 2. ✅ `get_pool_questions()`
**Lines added:** ~15 lines
```python
async def get_pool_questions(pool_id)
```
**What it does:**
- Queries `pool_questions` table for all questions in given pool
- Returns list of question dictionaries
- Handles demo mode gracefully

#### 3. ✅ `create_upload_batch()`
**Lines added:** ~25 lines
```python
async def create_upload_batch(pool_id, filename, total_questions, uploaded_by)
```
**What it does:**
- Creates record in `upload_batches` table
- Tracks which files were uploaded
- Returns batch_id for linking questions
- Initializes with 'processing' status

#### 4. ✅ `add_questions_to_pool()`
**Lines added:** ~60 lines
```python
async def add_questions_to_pool(pool_id, questions, source_file, batch_id)
```
**What it does:**
- Converts question list to database format
- Batch inserts all questions to `pool_questions` table
- Stores: question_text, choices (JSON), correct_answer, explanation, scenario
- Tracks source_file and batch_id for audit
- Updates batch statistics after insert
- Returns True on success

#### 5. ✅ `_update_batch_stats()` (Helper)
**Lines added:** ~20 lines
```python
async def _update_batch_stats(batch_id, questions_count, duplicates_found, unique_added)
```
**What it does:**
- Updates upload_batches record with final statistics
- Marks status as 'completed'
- Used internally after questions are added

## 🗄️ Database Schema Status

### Required Tables (from `database_schema_question_pools.sql`)

You need to apply this SQL in Supabase:

1. **`question_pools`** - Pool metadata
   - pool_name (unique), category, description
   - total_questions, unique_questions (auto-updated by trigger)
   - created_by, created_at, is_active

2. **`pool_questions`** - Individual questions
   - pool_id, question_text, choices (JSONB), correct_answer
   - explanation, difficulty, topic_tags
   - source_file, upload_batch_id
   - is_duplicate, duplicate_of, similarity_score
   - times_shown, times_correct, times_incorrect

3. **`upload_batches`** - Upload history
   - pool_id, filename, questions_count
   - duplicates_found, unique_added
   - upload_status, uploaded_by, uploaded_at

4. **`duplicate_cache`** - AI similarity cache
   - question1_id, question2_id
   - similarity_score, is_duplicate
   - ai_reasoning, checked_at

### 🚨 Action Required: Apply Database Schema

**Do this now:**
```sql
-- 1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT/sql
-- 2. Copy entire contents of: database_schema_question_pools.sql
-- 3. Paste into SQL Editor
-- 4. Click "Run"

-- 5. Verify tables created:
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND table_name IN ('question_pools', 'pool_questions', 'upload_batches', 'duplicate_cache');

-- Should return 4 rows
```

---

## 🎯 What You Can Do NOW

### Test the Complete System:

#### 1. Apply Database Schema (5 minutes)
- Go to Supabase SQL Editor
- Run `database_schema_question_pools.sql`
- Verify 4 tables created

#### 2. Upload Your First Question Pool (2 minutes)
```
1. Go to Admin → Upload Questions
2. Select: "💼 Question Pool"
3. Pool Name: "CACS2 Paper 2"
4. Category: "Finance & Accounting"
5. Upload: Your first PDF/Word file
6. Click "🚀 Upload to Question Pool"
```

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ File processed: CACS2-Paper2-V1.pdf
✅ Extracted: 50 questions
✅ Exact duplicates: 0
✅ AI duplicates: 0
✅ Unique added: 50

📊 Upload Summary:
- Files Processed: 1
- Total Extracted: 50
- Unique Added: 50
- Duplicates Skipped: 0
```

#### 3. Upload Second Version (Test Auto-Merge!)
```
1. Same pool name: "CACS2 Paper 2"  ← KEY: Same name = auto-merge
2. Upload: CACS2-Paper2-V2.pdf
3. Click "🚀 Upload to Question Pool"
```

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ Found 50 existing questions in pool
✅ Extracted: 50 questions from new file
✅ Exact duplicates: 12
✅ AI duplicates: 8
✅ Unique added: 30  ← Only new questions!

📊 Pool now has: 80 total questions from 2 files
```

#### 4. Verify in Database
```sql
-- Check pools
SELECT * FROM question_pools;

-- Check questions count
SELECT pool_id, COUNT(*) as question_count
FROM pool_questions
GROUP BY pool_id;

-- Check upload history
SELECT * FROM upload_batches
ORDER BY uploaded_at DESC;
```

## 🔍 How It Works (Complete Flow)

### User uploads PDF "CACS2-Paper2-V1.pdf" with pool name "CACS2 Paper 2"

**Step 1: Pool Setup**
```python
# db.create_or_update_question_pool()
# → Checks if "CACS2 Paper 2" exists
# → Not found, creates new pool
# → Returns pool_id: "a1b2c3d4..."
```

**Step 2: Extract Questions**
```python
# document_parser.parse_document()
# → Extracts text from PDF (PyPDF2)
# → Sends to OpenRouter AI
# → Returns 50 structured questions
```

**Step 3: Get Existing Questions**
```python
# db.get_pool_questions(pool_id)
# → First upload: returns []
# → Second upload: returns [50 existing questions]
```

**Step 4: Detect Duplicates**
```python
# question_pool_manager.detect_exact_duplicates()
# → Hash-based comparison (instant)
# → Finds 12 exact matches

# question_pool_manager.detect_similar_questions_with_ai()
# → AI semantic comparison (smart)
# → Finds 8 semantic matches at 95%+ similarity
# → Total duplicates: 20
# → Unique to add: 30
```

**Step 5: Create Batch Record**
```python
# db.create_upload_batch()
# → Creates audit record
# → Returns batch_id: "x1y2z3..."
```

**Step 6: Save Unique Questions**
```python
# db.add_questions_to_pool()
# → Batch inserts 30 questions
# → Links to pool_id and batch_id
# → Stores source_file for tracking
```

**Step 7: Update Statistics**
```python
# db._update_batch_stats()
# → Updates batch: questions_count=50, duplicates=20, unique=30
# → Marks status='completed'

# PostgreSQL trigger auto-updates:
# → question_pools.total_questions = 80
# → question_pools.unique_questions = 80
```

**Step 8: Show Results**
```python
# UI displays comprehensive summary
# → Files processed, extracted, added, skipped
# → Breakdown by file
# → Pool statistics
```

→ Check Supabase logs for RLS policy errors
→ Make sure admin user has proper permissions

**Need more help?**
Just ask! I can:
- Walk you through Supabase SQL deployment
- Debug any upload errors
- Tune duplicate detection settings
- Build the pool management dashboard
- Help with student exam generation
