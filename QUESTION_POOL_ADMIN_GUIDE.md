# 🎉 Question Pool System - Complete Implementation Guide

## ✅ What's Been Built

You now have a **complete question pool management system** for uploading and managing CACS Paper 2 PDFs with automatic duplicate detection!

### 1. **Backend Foundation** ✅

#### Database Methods (`db.py`)
- `create_or_update_question_pool()` - Create new pools or update existing ones by name
- `get_question_pool_by_name()` - Retrieve pool by name
- `get_pool_questions()` - Get all questions from a pool (excludes duplicates)
- `add_questions_to_pool()` - Add questions with duplicate tracking
- `create_upload_batch()` - Track each upload batch
- `get_all_question_pools()` - List all active pools with statistics

### 2. **Upload Processing** (`_pages_disabled/admin_upload.py`)✅

The `process_pool_upload()` function handles:
- **Multi-file processing** - Upload multiple PDFs at once
- **Exact duplicate detection** - Hash-based, instant matching
- **AI semantic detection** - Detects similar questions with configurable threshold
- **Real-time progress** - Shows which file is being processed
- **Batch tracking** - Records upload history
- **Comprehensive statistics** - Shows what was added, what was skipped

### 3. **Pool Management Dashboard** (`pages/admin_question_pools.py`) ✅

Full admin interface with:
- **View all pools** - See all question pools with statistics
- **Pool statistics** - Total questions, unique questions, duplicates removed
- **Search and filter** - Find questions by text search
- **Sort options** - By recent, most shown, most correct/incorrect
- **Question details** - View full question with choices, explanation, source
- **Edit/Delete** - Manage individual questions
- **Delete pools** - Remove entire pools (with confirmation)

### 4. **AI Duplicate Detection** (`question_pool_manager.py`) ✅

Smart duplicate detection with:
- **Cost optimization** - Uses free models first (Llama, Mistral), paid as fallback
- **Exact matching** - MD5 hash of question + choices
- **Semantic matching** - AI compares meaning, not just text
- **Configurable threshold** - Default 95%, adjustable 80-100%
- **Performance optimized** - Samples max 50 questions for AI comparison

## 🚀 Your Admin Workflow

### Step 1: Upload First PDF Version

1. Navigate to **Admin → Upload Mock** (when admin_upload.py is enabled)
2. Select: **"💼 Question Pool"** mode
3. Fill in details:
   - **Pool Name**: `CACS2 Paper 2` (this is the key - same name = auto-merge!)
   - **Category**: `Programming`
   - **Description**: Optional details about the pool
4. Upload: `CACS2-Paper2-V1.pdf`
5. Click: **"🚀 Upload to Question Pool"**

**Result:**
```
✅ Extracted 50 questions
✅ Added 50 unique questions
✅ Skipped 0 duplicates
```

### Step 2: Upload Second PDF Version

1. Same pool name: **`CACS2 Paper 2`** ← This makes it merge automatically!
2. Upload: `CACS2-Paper2-V2.pdf`
3. Click: **"🚀 Upload to Question Pool"**

**Result:**
```
📊 Found 50 existing questions in pool
✅ Extracted 50 questions from CACS2-Paper2-V2.pdf
📊 Exact duplicate detection: 15 exact matches found
🤖 AI detection: 0 semantic duplicates found (threshold: 95%)
✅ Added 35 unique questions
✅ Skipped 15 duplicates
```

### Step 3: View and Manage Your Pool

1. Navigate to **Admin → Question Pools**
2. See your pool: **CACS2 Paper 2** - 85 unique questions
3. Click **"👁️ View Questions"** to browse all questions
4. Search, sort, edit, or delete individual questions as needed

## 📋 Next Steps to Go Live

### 1. Apply Database Schema (Required First!)

Before you can use the question pool system, you need to create the database tables:

1. Open Supabase Dashboard → **SQL Editor**
2. Copy the contents of `database_schema_question_pools.sql`
3. Paste and click **"Run"**
4. Verify tables created:
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
   AND table_name IN ('question_pools', 'pool_questions', 'upload_batches', 'duplicate_cache');
   ```

### 2. Enable the Admin Upload Page

Currently admin_upload.py is in `_pages_disabled/`. To enable it:

**Option A: Move to pages folder**
```powershell
Move-Item "_pages_disabled\admin_upload.py" "pages\admin_upload.py"
```

**Option B: Create a new page that imports it**
```python
# pages/admin_upload.py
from _pages_disabled.admin_upload import show_admin_upload

if __name__ == "__main__":
    show_admin_upload()
```

### 3. Test with Real PDFs

1. Start your app: `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`
2. Login as admin
3. Navigate to Admin → Upload Mock
4. Upload your CACS Paper 2 PDFs
5. Check the results in Admin → Question Pools

### 4. Fine-Tune Settings (Optional)

In `question_pool_manager.py`, you can adjust:
- `self.similarity_threshold = 0.95` - Default AI similarity threshold
- Sample size for AI checks (currently 50 questions max)

## 💡 How It Works

### Duplicate Detection Process

1. **Upload Files** → System extracts questions from PDFs
2. **Exact Match** → Hash-based detection (instant, free)
3. **AI Semantic Match** → OpenRouter AI compares meaning (smart, small cost)
4. **Save Unique** → Only new questions added to pool
5. **Track Everything** → Batch history, source files, similarity scores

### Model Cascade (Cost Optimization)

When AI detection is enabled, the system tries models in this order:
1. 🆓 **Llama 3.3 70B** (free) - First choice
2. 🆓 **Mistral 7B** (free) - Second choice  
3. 💵 **Mixtral 8x7B** (paid) - Backup
4. 💵 **GPT-4o mini** (paid) - Final fallback

**This minimizes costs while maintaining reliability!**

## 📊 Database Schema Overview

### Tables Created

1. **`question_pools`** - Master pool records
   - pool_name, category, description
   - total_questions, unique_questions (auto-updated)
   - created_by, created_at, last_updated

2. **`pool_questions`** - Individual questions
   - question_text, choices (JSON), correct_answer
   - source_file, upload_batch_id
   - is_duplicate, duplicate_of, similarity_score
   - times_shown, times_correct, times_incorrect

3. **`upload_batches`** - Upload history
   - pool_id, filename, total_questions
   - uploaded_by, uploaded_at

4. **`duplicate_cache`** - AI comparison cache
   - question1_id, question2_id, similarity_score
   - Prevents redundant AI calls

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Table does not exist" error
→ Apply `database_schema_question_pools.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

### "Admin upload page not showing"
→ Enable admin_upload.py by moving it from `_pages_disabled/` to `pages/`

### AI duplicate detection not working
→ Check OpenRouter API key in `config.py` or `streamlit-secrets.toml`

### Questions not merging
→ Ensure exact same pool name (case-sensitive!)
