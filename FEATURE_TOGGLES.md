## üìä Answer Confidence Tracking

**Status:** üî¥ Hidden (Planned for future release)
**File:** `app_pages/exam.py` (lines 414-424)
**Feature:** Allows students to rate their confidence (0-100%) when answering questions

### Description
This feature adds an optional confidence slider below each question, asking students:
> "üí° Answer Confidence (Optional)
> How confident are you in this answer?"

**Purpose:**
- Track student confidence alongside correctness
- Identify knowledge gaps (low confidence + correct answers)
- Detect overconfidence (high confidence + incorrect answers)
- Provide insights for adaptive learning

### Why Hidden?
- Simplify initial user experience
- Focus on core exam functionality first
- Will enable when analytics features are expanded

### How to Enable

**Step 1:** Open `app_pages/exam.py`

**Step 2:** Find lines 414-424 and uncomment:

```python
# FEATURE HIDDEN: Answer confidence tracking
# Hiding for future release - uncomment to enable
with st.expander("üí° Answer Confidence (Optional)", expanded=False):
    confidence = st.slider(
        "How confident are you in this answer?",
        0,
        100,
        50,
        help="This helps us understand your learning progress",
        key=f"confidence_{question_index}",
    )
```

**Step 3:** Restart the app

**Step 4:** Test with a practice exam

### Backend Support

**Database:**
- ‚úÖ `attempts` table supports storing confidence data
- ‚úÖ Field: `confidence_level` (integer 0-100)

**Analytics:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Analytics dashboard has confidence visualization code
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Will need testing when feature is re-enabled

### Future Enhancements

When re-enabling this feature, consider:

1. **Make it optional per exam**
   - Let instructors toggle confidence tracking on/off per mock exam
   - Add setting in exam creation: "Track student confidence?"

2. **Enhanced analytics**
   - Confidence vs. correctness correlation
   - Overconfidence/underconfidence reports
   - Trend analysis over time

3. **Adaptive learning**
   - Flag questions where students are consistently overconfident

   - Adjust difficulty based on confidence patterns
