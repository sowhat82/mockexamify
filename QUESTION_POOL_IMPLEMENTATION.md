# Question Pool System - Implementation Summary

## âœ… What's Been Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (`database_schema_question_pools.sql`)

Created comprehensive database structure for question pool management:

**Tables Created:**
- `question_pools` - Master pools (e.g., "CACS2 Paper 2")
- `pool_questions` - Individual questions with duplicate tracking
- `upload_batches` - Audit trail for each PDF upload
- `duplicate_cache` - Caches AI similarity scores (performance optimization)

**Key Features:**
- Auto-updating pool statistics via triggers
- Duplicate detection tracking (is_duplicate, duplicate_of, similarity_score)
- Source file tracking for audit
- Upload batch grouping

### 2. AI-Powered Duplicate Detection (`question_pool_manager.py`)

Enhanced existing question pool manager with:

**Features:**
- âœ… **Exact Duplicate Detection** - Hash-based matching (fast)
- âœ… **Semantic Similarity Detection** - AI-powered (smart)
- âœ… **Cascading Model Fallback** - Uses your models_config.json
- âœ… **Automatic Merging** - Combines questions from multiple PDFs
- âœ… **Pool Statistics** - Tracks totals, duplicates, categories

**AI Integration:**
- Uses your OpenRouter API with free models first (cost-optimized)
- Falls back through 4 models if needed
- Similarity threshold: 95% = duplicate
- Sample-based checking (max 50 questions) for performance

### 3. Model Cascade System (`models_config.json`, `openrouter_utils.py`)

**Priority Order:**
1. `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free` (FREE)
2. `mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct:free` (FREE)
3. `mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct` (paid backup)
4. `openai/gpt-4o-mini` (reliable fallback)

Benefits:
- Saves money by using free models first
- Automatic fallback if model unavailable
- Detailed logging for debugging

## ðŸ“‹ Admin Workflow (Planned)

### Current Flow:
```
1. Admin uploads PDF: "CACS2-Paper2-V1.pdf"
2. Admin sets Pool Name: "CACS2 Paper 2"
3. System extracts questions from PDF
4. System checks each question for duplicates:
   - Exact match? â†’ Skip
   - 95%+ similar? â†’ Skip (AI detected)
   - Unique? â†’ Add to pool
5. Admin sees results:
   - "Added 45 unique questions"
   - "Skipped 5 duplicates"
```

### Next Upload:
```
1. Admin uploads: "CACS2-Paper2-V2.pdf"
2. Sets same Pool Name: "CACS2 Paper 2"
3. System auto-merges with existing pool
4. Detects duplicates across ALL versions
5. Only adds truly new questions
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps (To Do)

### Immediate:
1. **Apply Database Schema** - Run `database_schema_question_pools.sql` in Supabase
2. **Update Admin Upload Page** - Add "Pool Name" field
3. **Integrate PDF Parser** - Connect document_parser.py with question_pool_manager.py
4. **Add Admin Dashboard** - Show pool stats, upload history

### Soon:
1. **Test with Real PDFs** - Upload CACS Paper 2 versions
2. **Tune AI Similarity** - Adjust threshold based on results
3. **Add Manual Review** - Let admin review flagged duplicates
4. **Question Editing** - Allow admin to edit/delete individual questions

## ðŸ’¡ Key Benefits

### For You (Admin):
- âœ… **Just dump files** - No manual merging needed
- âœ… **Auto-detect duplicates** - AI handles the work
- âœ… **One pool per topic** - Easy to manage
- âœ… **Full audit trail** - Know what was uploaded when
- âœ… **Cost-optimized** - Free AI models first

### For Students (Later):
- Fresh questions each attempt (random from pool)
- More variety as you add versions
- Better practice experience

## ðŸ“Š Example After Implementation

```
Pool: "CACS2 Paper 2"
â”œâ”€â”€ Total Questions: 120
â”œâ”€â”€ Unique Questions: 95
â”œâ”€â”€ Upload Batches: 3
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ V1 (Jan 2024): 50 questions â†’ 45 added, 5 duplicates
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ V2 (Feb 2024): 50 questions â†’ 35 added, 15 duplicates
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ V3 (Mar 2024): 50 questions â†’ 15 added, 35 duplicates
â””â”€â”€ Status: Active

When student purchases:
â†’ Gets 50 random questions from the 95-question pool
â†’ Can retake for different mix
```

## ðŸš€ Ready to Continue?

The foundation is ready! Next steps:
1. Apply the database schema to Supabase
2. Update the admin upload page
3. Test with your CACS Paper 2 PDFs

Let me know when you're ready to proceed! ðŸŽ‰
