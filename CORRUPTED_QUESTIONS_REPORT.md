## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### What Happened
The document parser processes large documents in chunks (~8000 characters each). During the upload:

1. **Chunk 1 (Q1-Q49):** ‚úÖ Processed successfully
2. **Chunk 2+ (Q50-Q85):** ‚ùå Parser encountered issues
   - Possible OCR errors in that section
   - API timeout or rate limit hit
   - Chunk boundary split questions incorrectly
   - AI returned placeholder data when it couldn't parse properly

### Evidence

- All 85 questions uploaded in single batch
