   - [ ] Monitor error logs
   - [ ] Set up monitoring alerts

### Option 2: Docker Deployment

1. **Container Setup**
   ```bash
   # Build production image
   docker build -t mockexamify:latest .
   
   # Test locally
   docker run -p 8501:8501 --env-file .env.prod mockexamify:latest
   ```

2. **Cloud Deployment**
   - [ ] Choose cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure)
   - [ ] Set up container registry

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip nginx certbot
   
   # Clone repository
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd mockexamify
   
   # Install Python dependencies
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Service Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Create systemd service
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/mockexamify.service
   
   # Enable and start service
   sudo systemctl enable mockexamify
   sudo systemctl start mockexamify
   ```

3. **Reverse Proxy Setup**
   ```nginx
   # Nginx configuration
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name your-domain.com;
       
       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:8501;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
       }
   }
   ```
