   - Update pool to 85 questions total

**Important:** When re-uploading, the deduplication system will automatically skip questions that already exist and only add the new ones.

## üîç Why This Happened

The original upload processed the document in chunks:
- **Chunk 1 (Q1-Q49):** ‚úÖ Processed successfully
- **Chunk 2+ (Q50-Q85):** ‚ùå AI parser encountered issues
  - Possible OCR errors in that section
  - API timeout or rate limit
  - Returned placeholder data

This has been documented in [CORRUPTED_QUESTIONS_REPORT.md](CORRUPTED_QUESTIONS_REPORT.md) for future reference.
